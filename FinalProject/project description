With the purpose to “see” the music piece La Folía while listening to it, we explored and processed the La Folía MIDI data, 
then created an interactive visualization system. 

The original MIDI data exported from the MuseScore database is then processed from a binary encoded music data file to a JSON file and a CSV file. 

Our goal is to visualize La Folía in deep along with a music play.

Visualization includes:
    - a Radial scatter plot which introduces the music piece based on information of each music node, 
    - a Tonnetz visualization plot which shows detailed music texture information for professional analyzation, 
    - an Arc diagram which describes the whole structure of the music piece.
